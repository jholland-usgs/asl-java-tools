 * The FallOffQueue is a queue who's elements "fall off the end" when
 * its maximum capacity is exceeded.
 * This is not thread safe. We never run the risk of out of order data, but
 * we can fail to add an element after pushing off the last element. This
 * is a result of extending LinkedBlockingQueue.
