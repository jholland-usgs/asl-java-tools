/*  SEED Manual - Appendix C
 *  PoleZero Representation for Analog Stages
 *    The first part of any seismic sensor will be some sort of linear system that operates in
 *    continuous time, rather than discrete time. Usually, any such system has a frequency response
 *    that is the ratio of two complex polynomials, each with real coefficients.  These polynomials
 *    can be represented either by their coefficients or (preferably) by their roots (poles and zeros).
 *
 *    The polynomials are specified by their roots.  The roots of the numerator polynomial are the
 *    instrument zeros, and the roots of the denominator polynomial are the instrument poles.
 *    Because the polynomials have real coefficients, complex poles and zeros will occur in complex
 *    conjugate pairs.  By convention, the real parts of the poles and zeros are negative.
 *
 *    The expansion formula gives the response ( G(f) ) at any frequency f (Hz), using the variable:
 *      s = 2*pi*i*f (rad/sec) if the PoleZero transfer function is type A  -OR-
 *      s = i*f (Hz)           if the PoleZero transfer function is type B
*/

/*  Evaluate the polezero response at a single frequency, f
 *  Return G(f) = A0 * pole zero expansion
 *  Note that the stage sensitivity Sd is *not* included, so that the response from this
 *  stage should be approx. 1 (flat) at the mid range.
